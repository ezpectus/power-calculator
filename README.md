# power-calculator


**What the Code Does**

1.  **Gets Input:**
    * It asks the user to enter two numbers:
        * `x`: The base number (the number you'll multiply).
        * `n`: The exponent (how many times you multiply `x` by itself).
    * It then reads these numbers from the user's input.

2.  **Calculates the Power:**
    * It uses a special function called `Power(x, n)` to calculate `x` raised to the power of `n`.
    * This function is clever. It uses a technique called "binary exponentiation" to do the calculation efficiently.
        * If the exponent `n` is even, it breaks the calculation into smaller parts.
        * If the exponent `n` is odd, it multiplies `x` by `x` raised to the power of `n - 1`.
    * This is a much faster way to calculate powers than just multiplying `x` by itself `n` times.

3.  **Displays the Result:**
    * It prints the result of the power calculation to the console.

**Let's look at the `Power(x, n)` function in detail:**

* **`if (n == 0)`:**
    * If the exponent `n` is 0, it returns 1. (Anything to the power of 0 is 1).
* **`if ((n & 1) == 0)`:**
    * This checks if `n` is even. The `&` operator is a bitwise AND, and `(n & 1)` checks the last bit of `n`. If it's 0, `n` is even.
    * If `n` is even, it calculates `Power(x, n / 2)` and multiplies the result by itself.
* **`else`:**
    * If `n` is odd, it calculates `x * Power(x, n - 1)`.

**Example:**

If you enter `x = 2` and `n = 3`, the program will calculate 2 to the power of 3 (2 \* 2 \* 2), which is 8, and then it will print "Результат: 8".

**Why this code is useful:**

* Calculating powers is a common operation in many areas of computer science and mathematics.
* The "binary exponentiation" technique used in the `Power` function is very efficient, especially for large exponents.
